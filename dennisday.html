      were invited to come in to Highwood to share their memories and knowledge of the town.&nbsp; 
      Extracts from two very different transcripts have been included here. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial">One of the visitors, the late Dennis Day, 
      proved to be an entertaining storyteller when he came to visit us on 
      Friday, 11 January 1991.&nbsp; After telling us about his pigeons, he 
      launched into a fascinating tour of his memories.</font></p>
      <p>
      <font face="Arial">Here are some extracts from his conversation with 
      Highwood pupils and staff (based on transcripts prepared by Alice Day).</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">School</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"The school that is there now was called the British 
      Boys' School when I was five and that was all boys.&nbsp; The girls were 
      down at Nailsworth and every year, at the end of term, they used to have a 
      partition in the school down there, a glass partition, that they could 
      pull back and make one big room. And the girls came up from the girls' 
      school, they would be in one side and we would be in the other side, and 
      the master, by the name of Wallis, the headmaster, he could play a violin.&nbsp; 
      There were a couple of other boys who could play violins, and they played 
      recordings and there was a singsong with everybody before we broke up."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"We had a master down at this school, by the name of 
      Lewis, he was a Welsh man, and when he came there the first day I had the 
      cane twice.&nbsp; The second time I had the cane I thought, 'Dennis, it's 
      time you didn't go to school until that bloke has gone,' so the next day I 
      got up with a violent headache and I didn't go to school, and the next 
      day, I thought, 'I shall have to keep this headache up or else they'll 
      make me go to school,' so I had another violent headache, and in the end I 
      ended up being taken to the doctor.&nbsp; The doctor turned round and 
      couldn't find anything wrong with me, so mother had to take me to Stroud 
      to the hospital. And they turned round and said, 'Well to find out what's 
      really wrong with him, it is best to give him white meat, fish and 
      chicken, not to give him anything else.'&nbsp; There was nothing wrong 
      with me. I was just glad to see the back of the master.&nbsp; Anyway, he 
      went, and I was glad to go back to school then."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Audience: "Did they cane you on your bottom?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"You did get the cane for practically anything then.&nbsp; 
      You had the cane, and some of them got quite good at the cane.&nbsp; This 
      one bloke would say,' Hold&nbsp; your hand out,' and you did try to keep 
      getting your hand back, and he would say ' get your hand back' and had the 
      cane like this.&nbsp; And, all of a sudden, the cane would come up and 
      nearly hit your hand and up would go your hand and the cane would come up 
      underneath your hand. Bump up would go your hand and the same cane would 
      meet your hand going down.&nbsp; Urggggh!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There was a boiler down at that school, down in the 
      playground, and they coked it up with coke in the winter to warm the 
      school up.&nbsp; The master did come down in breaktime, playtime, and 
      shovel this coke in, and do the boiler while we were playing in the yard.&nbsp; 
      One day it has been snowing, but [there] weren't a lot of snow, and we 
      were down in the yard playing and the master came down to coke up.&nbsp; I 
      grabbed hold of this snow, and I reckon I must have got some grit and that 
      in with the snow, in this snowball, and I said, 'What's the betting as I 
      couldn't hit him?'&nbsp; And, as he turned to go back up to the school, I 
      threw right into his face. He swung round and seen us two stood looking at 
      him and he come across and said to the kiddie as was stood by me 'come 
      with me' and off to the school the kid went and when I got up there ha had 
      had the cane. [<i>laughter</i>] I was the one what done it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">I was kept in once.&nbsp; I was walking out through 
      the headmaster's class and he said, 'Go back to your classroom and wait 
      until I let you out,' so he went on with his own class and he forgot me.&nbsp; 
      The headmaster went and he locked all the school up and I suddenly 
      realised I was in the school all on my own.&nbsp; I started yelling and 
      kids from round the school they shouted because the windows were high up 
      there and you couldn't see out. And they said, 'Break all the canes up and 
      we will go and get the master and let you out.'&nbsp; I didn't do that 
      'cause I would have got the cane again.&nbsp; Anyway, they fetched the 
      master and it was 7 o'clock at night when he came up and let me out, and 
      there was about twenty children outside gave me a big cheer as I came out 
      of the door.&nbsp; I run down into the Stroud Road and run down that way 
      and got into trouble for being late."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">School Punishment and School Attendance</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"Don't do what I used to do at school, you aren't so 
      bad off nowadays cause they don't let you have the cane now do they?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Well, when I was a boy around your age, I went to 
      the boys' school down the bottom here, which is the infants' school.&nbsp; 
      You went up there, I suppose, about nine to the infants school, and the 
      girls stayed down at Nailsworth at the girls' school, and you left at 
      fourteen then, look, unless you went to Marling, Tech or High School in 
      them days.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a lot of poor people around in them 
      days, poor families, and you had to buy your own school uniform, your 
      parents had to buy the school uniforms, and so a lot of children didn't 
      get the chance to go.&nbsp; My sister passed for the High School and I 
      passed for the Technical School, but couldn't go because there was 10 of 
      us in the family and my parents couldn't afford to let us go.&nbsp; But it 
      was a good school, we had a good headmaster, Mr Wallis, he didn't use the 
      cane too much. But he did use the cane, 'cause my hands are a bit bigger 
      than they should be where they was caned when I was small, and across my 
      backside. I had six of them across my backside once, and the master said, 
      'You needn't sit down, Day, if you don't want to,' and I didn't want to. I 
      had to stand up for quite a while.&nbsp; That was because, going home at 
      dinner time I met a kiddie who lived right up Chestnut Hill.&nbsp; We took 
      the top off his bike and threw that over the hedge; we took the bolts out 
      of his tyres and threw them up to the top of the hill and his spokes went 
      the same way; and then we went home.&nbsp; When we got back to school the 
      first person we seen was this kiddie with his mother, so we knew trouble 
      was coming.&nbsp; Anyway, when we all sat down at school, in walked this 
      kiddie with his mother and the headmaster, and the other boy and me had to 
      go out.&nbsp; Five of us had to go out to the headmaster's desk and he 
      went to the cupboard and got the best cane he could and then, I was the 
      first, he laid me across the desk and gave me six of the best, when the 
      boy's mother had gone.&nbsp; It didn't half hurt, it really hurt. "</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"We used to walk from Harley Wood, do you know where 
      Harley Wood is?&nbsp; It's a little village where you look across from the 
      Fisheries there and do you know Barton End?&nbsp; Up the Bath Road, right 
      up to the top till you get almost to the top of the hill, there is a big 
      house there. And I used to go to Hilliers, to the dinner time, go home, 
      mother would say your father wants a cooked meal and she would put the 
      plate, and another plate on top of that and the top of a cottage loaf.&nbsp; 
      A cottage loaf is a loaf with a small round top, and she would the whole 
      top of that on the top of a plate and I would carry that, then up the 
      Barton End to the big house. And if it was a nice day, he would say, 'You 
      aren't going back to school,' -&nbsp; I used to like that.&nbsp; He would 
      cut the top of the cottage loaf in half and he would go into the 
      greenhouse and bring out tomatoes, whatever 'twas they growed in the 
      greenhouse, and he brought them to the corner of the house and they would 
      bring a big jug of tea and we did have our dinner there then look. And 
      then I would go out on the garden and we would work then until five 
      o'clock.&nbsp; You got an attendance officer comes round now to see if you 
      don't come to school, well we had an attendance officer then called Ben 
      Weager and he had a little Austin 7 car. And we was outside the gate at 
      the British Boys' School one afternoon and Ben Weager pulled up there in 
      this Austin 7 car and he caught both these boys and he had them in the 
      back of the car.&nbsp; The master came out and looked around and he didn't 
      have them any more. They'd opened the car door and they shot down the 
      lane, both of them, he'd lost them again.&nbsp; They couldn't get them to 
      school, just couldn't.&nbsp; The plantation there just below the school, 
      there was some trees there, and they used to get up them trees, and, one 
      day, they was right up the top of these trees when the bell went, and the 
      master came out 'cause he had already rung the bell.&nbsp; And we all went 
      to school, bar the boys who was up the tree, three of them, and one of 
      them was out of class, and the master turned round.&nbsp; ............... 
      They left them, and they came down on their own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There was a woman by the name of Mrs Britton, the 
      master caned her boy and she came up with an umbrella, and when the master 
      went to see her in the cloakroom, she fetched him across the top of the 
      head with her umbrella.&nbsp; They was rough then.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The master turned round and said he had this for 
      [him], and he gave him the cane, and the boy went back, and the desks used 
      to slope, like that in them days, and there was little ink pots in the top 
      and the boy went back to his desk.&nbsp; The master turned round to the 
      blackboard, and the boy stuck his finger in the pot and he threw it and he 
      just missed the master's head.&nbsp; Smack against the blackboard, the ink 
      all came out, the master turned round, and he said, 'I'll tell your father 
      about you tonight.'&nbsp; The kid turned round, walked out of the school 
      and he never came back."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Hilliers and Animals</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"The pigs used to come in to Hilliers, you know, up 
      the Newmarket Road. Hilliers, they used to do all their own killings in 
      those days; they used to kill up to 1,000 pigs a week; they used to bring 
      these pigs in on the rail.&nbsp; We could hear these pigs squealing from 
      the school when they did come in about three o'clock in the afternoon, 
      shunting about.&nbsp; They did drive them up the little alley by what used 
      to be a garage, (it isn't a garage now, as you go towards Stroud, and 
      there is a lane come up by the school there,) come up by the infants' 
      school where they did drive the pigs across the road there and up that 
      lane and along the private road down into Newmarket Road and up to the 
      Hilliers, 'cause there wasn't the lorries about in them days.&nbsp; Well, 
      in the summer, a lot of these pigs did drop down with exhaustion and they 
      did leave them in the side of the road.&nbsp; We come out of school and 
      pigs would be led in the side of the road, they did come back with some 
      sort of transport and get the pigs on and take 'um on up to the train.&nbsp; 
      I have seen younger boys if the pig got O.K. while they was away, they 
      would have a ride on the pig's back." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Audience: "Did you ever do that, did you ride on the 
      pig's back?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"I never rode on the pig's back. There is a donkey 
      there owned by old Tom Brain.&nbsp; He had this donkey and trap and he 
      used to go round selling bootlaces and black (boot polish) and things like 
      that, and dishcloths, and he kept the donkey in a field up the back of 
      Harley Wood.... we took some bread up there one day and give this donkey 
      this bread over the five-bar gate, and somebody said, 'Who'll ride him?' 
      and I said I would.&nbsp; So I got on the five-bar gate, and I jumped 
      across his back and galloped about here to that door and then his back end 
      came up and I went sailing. I was a-flying.&nbsp; That's a bray donkey, 
      and I didn't half get out of that, I hit me head, and I chased that donkey 
      round the field afterwards for throwing me off."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Audience: "Was that the same donkey that got in the 
      grain that time?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"Yes that donkey.&nbsp; After this fellow died, my 
      father bought the donkey, and he kept it up in the loft, but he used to 
      raise pigeons, keep pigeons, and did have the pigeon grub in the dustbin, 
      and that donkey did knock the lid off the dustbin and eat the food.&nbsp; 
      He did roll the dustbin right down.&nbsp; I thought, 'I'll stop that,' and 
      I tied the two animals together with some rope, and then I kept it in the 
      shed, and I went over one day, and the donkey was on the floor, and he 
      rolled the floor like this, and I said to my father, 'That donkey ain't 
      well, he won't get up.'&nbsp; I said, ' Where you got your pigeons 
      too......' He could have died -&nbsp; he ate all my pigeon food.&nbsp; 
      That went on for a long time, we had to take turns walking him."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Poverty</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Audience: "Were people very poor in those days?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"They was very, very poor, and another things was 
      the butchers didn't have fridges as they are called now so they did their 
      own killing, the butchers, and at the end of the week, what meat they had 
      left was no good.&nbsp; They had to get rid of it, so a lot of people 
      didn't go shopping till 7.30 ' cause shops kept open till 8 at night and 
      they would go shopping at 7.30 because they could get bargains then 
      because they knowed the butcher couldn't get rid of it and you could get a 
      hunk of beef that big round for next to nothing then .....</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">As a boy I used to go down Butcher's Hill with a 
      truck with perambulator wheels on and there wasn't the traffic on the 
      roads then and my father used to say, 'Stop at the top of Butchers Hill,' 
      and he would come up with a sack bag full of meat where he'd been to the 
      butchers and he put this on the truck and I would have to pull that home 
      while he did go back to the pub. And there would be the Sunday joint in 
      there, there'd be sheep heads, cows' heads and the people in the village 
      used to come up and mother used to cut the meat off in a big basin and she 
      would make broth. (They used to boil up the heads.)&nbsp; It was nice if 
      you had sauce with it to camouflage it, make it taste alright.&nbsp; It 
      was good for you, and you had bread pudding, all the stale bread was 
      soaked and made into bread pudding - that was good... there was a lot of 
      fat people about in them days.&nbsp; Dripping on the bread, put pepper on 
      top to make it taste better.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There was a cattle market at Nailsworth in them 
      days, on a Tuesday I think it was. And where you go into the bus park, all 
      along there was rails and fencing and they did sell the cattle there, on 
      the top side where the garage is and the cafe, that was pens for pigs for 
      sheep.&nbsp; We used to run down there after school and watch them being 
      sold.&nbsp; There wasn't the cars about and that in them days and the pub 
      did keep open all day long and there was a lot of unemployment and they 
      used to go to the pub and get the drovers out and they would get them to 
      drive whatever they bought back to where they belonged and you would see 
      people in the gutter blind drunk, drunk as anything.&nbsp; Everybody used 
      to drink then,............my father and two others ......... had stone 
      jars and I used to have to keep going down to price' and getting the jars 
      filled up with cider."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Nailsworth Butchers</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"They [Nailsworth butchers] used to do their own 
      killing.&nbsp; There was Saunders's, Taylor's, Price's, Neal's. They all done 
      their own killing, bought their own cattle, sheep and that and done their 
      own killing at the back of their place.&nbsp; And, in the car park, as you 
      came in from where the buses come in on the side, the bottom side, where 
      the cars are parked all along there to the fountain, that was the cattle 
      place, railed off, and the cattle was kept in there, and the top side 
      where the cafe is and garage, that was pens for sheep and pigs and we used 
      to come out of school, go down there and watch the stuff being sold.&nbsp; 
      And the pub did keep open all day then on that particular day and there 
      wasn't the lorries that you drove the cattle up in around in them days. 
      They used to drive what they did buy, drive them home and they did go into 
      the pub, and get these blokes out of the pub (there was a lot of 
      unemployment about as drovers, and the butchers used to buy their cattle 
      there and where Gateway [supermarket] was, that block of shops there, that 
      used to be a paddock, two paddocks, Taylor's and Saunders', and up the 
      back of Brewery Lane, where the social club is, up the back of there, 
      there is a little paddock there where Neal did keep his stock.&nbsp; We 
      would run from school down to Neal's, and they had a tin door, and we 
      would push that door open and we did watch them do the killing.&nbsp; They 
      did grab the sheep, bring them up, turn them upside down, on this, like, 
      bench, wooden bench job, and they would cut their throats.&nbsp; Oh, they 
      was cruel."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Poaching and Ferrets</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"There was a lot of rabbits around, pheasants, that 
      sort of thing, and we used to go, when we was at school we had our ferrets 
      and these went ferreting.&nbsp; You get a net, what they call <i>first</i> 
      nets, and they were about that long pulled tight, and they was on a cord 
      and they just dropped over the top of the hole and down on the ground at 
      the side, and they netted all the holes round and you put the ferrets in 
      and you could hear the ferrets groaning away, and all of a sudden, chunk, 
      and out would come the rabbit into the net, and you killed him. Yeah, 
      everyone ate rabbits in them days, that was how they lived.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We went ferreting this day, and there was a tree 
      down.&nbsp; It was winter and this tree was down up the Hazel Wood, a fir 
      tree, and there was these rabbit holes there and we put ferrets into the 
      nets and we had six rabbits and the boy I was with said,' There's a fellow 
      coming along, get down and he won't see us.' So we got down there and the 
      next thing we knew we heard a crunch and he was looking down at us, and we 
      was poaching see, so he turned round and he had to grab the ferrets and 
      put them in bags and take the nets off and he walked us down to the 
      Weighbridge.&nbsp; And he marched us along them houses there up to the big 
      house and the gardener there was the gamekeeper at this place and he 
      turned round and he said, 'I've brought you two young poachers here, 
      Joss,' and he turned round.&nbsp; He knew my father, this gamekeeper, and 
      he said, 'Peter Day's your father,' and I said, 'Yes,' and he said, 'Don't 
      go up there again.&nbsp; I better take some meat for my trouble,' and he 
      took a rabbit off the end of the stick and he let us have the other five 
      rabbits, and we was back in the wood half an hour later and picked up two 
      rabbits we hid in the burrow -&nbsp; we wasn't going to lose them."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Audience: "Did the ferrets ever kill the rabbit down 
      the hole?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"Yes, that's what we call '<i>kill-in</i>'.&nbsp; 
      They killed the rabbits down the hole.&nbsp; They will eat so much of the 
      rabbit and they will curl up and sleep there and you've got to go back the 
      next day, you know.&nbsp; What we used to do, we used to always keep a 
      dead rabbit.&nbsp; If somebody got a rabbit, we used to always keep one 
      dead, look.&nbsp; If we wanted the third out, we would bang the hole and 
      he would come through as far as you could see and we would put the rabbit 
      down and he would bite hold of him and we would drag him out and get him 
      over the top.&nbsp; We lost two ferrets one day when we was ferreting down 
      the wood.&nbsp; My uncle was bailiff of Williams' farm out at Chavenage 
      and he didn't care who it was, you know, he was a strict bloke.&nbsp; We 
      had the two ferrets down in the net and we heard a rattle from the top of 
      the wood, and we was gone.&nbsp; We didn't stop then, we run, and he was 
      in the pub that night in the Black Horse, saying he chased two poachers.&nbsp; 
      But he didn't chase us 'cause we'd gone, and he had two ferrets and all 
      our nets.&nbsp; My father went down there and he heard him, and he came 
      back and said, 'We'll get that bloke back for them ferrets.'... they used 
      to go rabbiting in them days with a long net - we had a 60 yard net - 
      there was a 100 yard and 60 yard net and you just put the pin in the 
      ground and run the net right out in the dark and you would have what we 
      called <i>peg sticks</i>, about that long, and you would wrap them around 
      the bottom of the line ands then wrap it round the top line so that the 
      net is pitched up in the air and you go right back to the end. And if you 
      had a good dog, a good dog was worth his weight in gold.&nbsp; We had a 
      collie, and she was really good, and she would stop there until you got 
      back.&nbsp; One would be at one end of the net and one at the other end, 
      you couldn't see 'cause it was dark, and you would be at the top of the 
      net and the dog would go straight out and you could hear the dog going 
      down and he would come near to you, the rabbit would be in front of him, 
      the rabbit would hit the net and the dog would jump straight on the net, 
      turn round and fetch another rabbit in.&nbsp; A good dog was trained never 
      to hit the net.&nbsp; We went out, and my father said, 'We'll make him pay 
      for that, and we went down in them same fields where we lost the ferrets 
      and the nets and we had fifteen to twenty rabbits that night and that was 
      a long walk home for a boy 'cause rabbits is heavy and you can carry so 
      many, and you can't carry them all, but we did carry so many rabbits, drop 
      them down at the end of the field agin' the wall, go back for the rest, go 
      over the wall, and go back, but we got our money's worth, we got our money 
      back, yeah."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Licence</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"We would get a couple of cartridges after I done 
      the gardening at night, and go shooting, but I got caught on a Boxing Day 
      - a policeman caught me -&nbsp; but that was on my own ground, and I had a 
      garden gun and it had been snowing and I had a shot at these birds.&nbsp; 
      I shouldn't have done, and I heard the gate go, looked down, and there was 
      the policeman.&nbsp; He said, 'Where's that gun?' He said, 'I want that 
      gun.'&nbsp; I showed him the gun and he said I didn't need a licence for a 
      garden gun. A garden gun is like&nbsp; 4 -10 but smaller.&nbsp; The 
      cartridge, when you put it in and fire it, there is only the brass end 
      left, the paper all went with the shot.&nbsp; And I had a letter from the 
      taxation people at Gloucester to pay 10 shillings and no more would be 
      heard of it, and my father said, 'If you pay that 10shillings or I hear of 
      anyone paying that 10shillings in this house, there will be one hell of a 
      row here.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">And this copper come up the lane, and my father sat 
      there and I'm sat here, and he come down and he said, 'What did you say 
      that gun was?'&nbsp; And my father said, 'You get back thur, your turn 
      will come in a minute.'&nbsp; Anyways my father said that he had me for 
      crossing the road with a gun, on the highway, to get to the allotment, and 
      my father said the gun's always kept up in the allotment.&nbsp; Course it 
      wasn't, and they dismissed the case, and he looked up at the copper, he 
      was a big copper, and he said, 'That had you!' and he walked out."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Nailsworth Court</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"We went to Court, all of us, all the Harley Wood 
      boys.&nbsp; The Nailsworth sergeant would come up and, as he did come 
      through the door in the British Boys' School, the master would give one 
      look at him coming through the door and he did come into all the different 
      classes and get all the Harley Wood lot out, and nine times out of ten he 
      was right.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Up past Harley Wood in the lane there's some old 
      sheds, they're still there, and we did go in them messing about, but the 
      older men did get in there playing cards.&nbsp; They did break a bit of 
      wood or timber off and take it home for the fire, and we got the blame, 
      and there was fourteen of us in Court.&nbsp; Nailsworth had a Court then 
      look, where the doctor's is now, Dr Endacott's.&nbsp; At the back of there 
      was a red brick building, you went up the steps to the top and there was a 
      Court there and we all had to go in there with our parents.&nbsp; We got 
      dismissed anyway, pushed the blame on to the gamblers, and I got caught 
      not long after that for being in another shed, and I nearly went to the 
      Reformatory for that because the sergeant said to my father, ' Coming so 
      soon after the last lot if this do get to Court I am afraid your boy will 
      go up to the Reformatory. ' And all I was a-doing was hacking through the 
      ivy on top of this shed because there was a walnut tree and all the nuts 
      had fallen into the ivy, and any rate my father gave me a damn good hiding 
      and we went and seen the governor and had it squashed before it came to 
      court."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Swimming Pool</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"Then there was a swimming pool round at Johnson's, 
      they paid £16 2s 6d in those days, you paid to be a member.&nbsp; It was 
      cold water, but we used to swim there, we had a lot of fun there."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"... does anyone know Johnson's Mill?&nbsp; Round 
      the back on the way to Ruscombe.&nbsp; There was a big swimming pool 
      there, all open air, they used to have occasionally there.&nbsp; We used 
      to sit on the bank on the opposite side, where the road was sliding last 
      year, them houses there on the bank, they wasn't there then, that was just 
      a paddock, with geese and that in the paddock.&nbsp; But one day they put 
      seats along there to watch the swimming.&nbsp; I won the 1934, I won the 
      cup there for the best learner for that year.&nbsp; Little did they know 
      but I was swimming the year before, up on the Ruskin Mill.&nbsp; I used to 
      swim in there, and we used to go fishing, with little white bags, with 
      bread in them, twist them round a cane and go fishing.&nbsp; I remember 
      swimming in that Ruscombe Mill and I have seen this bag floating up and I 
      let him go back down, he had a dead cat in him, he went back."</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial">Nailsworth Show</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"They put on a show at Nailsworth like Stroud Show - 
      a big show. It was better than Stroud because they used to employ men to 
      build the jumps for 3 days, horse jumps this is, and they would have top 
      horse riders come there on the jumps. The money was good, everything was 
      good, and it was a big occasion.&nbsp; 1930 I was ten year old then, and 
      we were going down to the show from Harley Wood at night.&nbsp; There was 
      a pigeon on the roof opposite and it was just as if the pigeon knew what 
      was coming because he flew off the roof, bang into the window, out the 
      bedroom window upstairs, and my father said, 'Open that window, he's going 
      to smash that window if he carries on like that,' which I did do.&nbsp; 
      And the sky turned a dirty horrible colour all over coming up like from 
      Bristol way, so we got down to Nailsworth, down there by the Comrades 
      club, that lane going down there, and we had to run down there into 
      people's houses at the bottom to shelter. That sky opened up, it emptied 
      down, and that went on - thunder, lightning - the show never ever come 
      back again though, that finished the Nailsworth show.&nbsp; Everybody had 
      had enough of it, and we had the floats, the lake up at Newmarket, the top 
      end of Newmarket, that burst its banks, came down to the next lake, which 
      was Kingsmill, that burst and went down underneath and washed some of the 
      machinery out, on down at the back, took the pigs and fowls away with it, 
      and I don't know whether it is in there.&nbsp; It lifted up the road 
      outside the Brit[ Britannia], the other side, where the florist's place 
      is, all that was lifted up, where the Club is on the cross that was a 
      draper's shop, it done a lot of damage."</font></p></td>

      <p><font face="Arial">Betty Mills also visited Highwood in January 1991 
      and shared her knowledge of local history with her young audience.&nbsp; 
      Here are extracts from her talk:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"If you look out of the window here, from the 
      library, you will see the playing fields, and yards and yards of open 
      space.&nbsp; Well, it wasn't always like that.&nbsp; In the past this was 
      all forest, for miles and miles around, from here to the edge of Tetbury, 
      and then right up to Woodchester</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">If we go back to the past..., Nailsworth was covered 
      with forests.&nbsp; In fact, a long, long time ago it was a royal hunting 
      forest.&nbsp; Henry VIII didn't like coming all this way from Windsor so 
      he swapped forests here with forests at Windsor, which is why we get the 
      name Windsoredge [and Windsor Ash].&nbsp; You know what kings do, or used 
      to do: it was called swapping, <i>but you jolly well do what I tell you</i>. 
      So he got lots of land near Windsor, and the Dukes of Windsor got this 
      land.&nbsp; It was very, very isolated, and at a time when Gloucester had 
      a gorgeous Cathedral and grand houses, Nailsworth was totally unknown and 
      there were just a few little hamlets, a cottage or two, and the people in 
      the cottages got wool from the millers, and spun it and wove it in their 
      own homes.&nbsp; At one time, when there was a school being run by the 
      Chapel, which I'll tell you about, they could only have them in summer 
      because the children were so poor that they hadn't enough clothes to keep 
      them warm and they also didn't want to spend money on heating. So they 
      were as poor as that and you were self-sufficient, and, in the summer, you 
      fattened the pig and, in the winter, you killed him and salted him and 
      stuck him up on your beams, and so on, and you grazed your pig in beech 
      leaves.&nbsp; Anyway, the beginning of things happening in modern times, 
      (I count modern times as from about 1600 onwards) was that there was a 
      kind of law in force..." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"it was about 300 years ago, 1662, in fact, when 
      things began to happen..."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">...[according to the Act of Uniformity] all the 
      vicars in the churches had to obey every word in the prayer book and often 
      didn't like this and didn't like some of the words in the prayer book, and 
      so they were turned out of their vicarages, about 2,000 of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      It was a criminal offence to worship anywhere else, and so what they did 
      was they got together in secret and they met in secret, safe places, and 
      one of the secret, safe places they found was just across the road [in a 
      clearing in the forest] called Forest Green........ if they had been 
      discovered they would have been sent to prison, so it was a rather 
      dangerous operation.&nbsp; People came from all over Gloucestershire, as 
      far away as Tewkesbury, to meet in this area, and the rector at Avening 
      down the road past Gatcombe, he was splendid.&nbsp; I reckon he probably 
      had a family of small children and he didn't like the idea of leaving his 
      home, and so, to be reasonably safe, although he was still a vicar, he put 
      an old route through Nailsworth up to Gloucester nearby here.&nbsp; Now 
      that was very important, because of a long story which I can't tell you 
      now, but from that one meeting in the end they built chapels, and the 
      chapels are churches, but they don't follow the same rules as the Anglican 
      church.&nbsp; And there were several chapels in Nailsworth, one up here 
      and another one over there in Newmarket, and that became one of the most 
      famous Baptist chapels outside London or Bristol, and about 120 years ago, 
      they had 700 people coming there every Sunday.&nbsp; Of course, it was a 
      bit different in those days. Many of the people worked in their own homes, 
      and so Sunday was their day out, and they went and spent the whole day 
      there and came from 30 miles around.&nbsp; Some people came on ponies, 
      there were stables, and altogether it was very famous and people come from 
      all over the world to look at the place.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Most, in fact, almost all of the people in the area 
      wove and spun and ... we didn't have big mills like Dunkirk, which you all 
      see as you go home, until about 1780 or thereabouts, and they arrived 
      because machinery arrived and, instead of doing it all by hand in your own 
      home, you had to go in a factory.... I have got letters to people who ran 
      the mills, and they were always referred to as factories....... the local 
      people didn't like it at all, ... there was a big strike on Selsey Common 
      objecting to the factories... [On a typical working day] everybody 
      went....at 7.30 in the morning, you probably walked from Newmarket all the 
      way down the road to Longfords Mill, and you didn't stop until 7 at night, 
      and it was very noisy, very hot, and you got poorly paid.&nbsp; Eventually 
      the wool industry failed here...... and a lot of people went up to 
      Yorkshire...and others went to Australia....... "</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"When the wool industry failed, other industries 
      started up and one of then was Nailsworth Brewery.&nbsp; If you live in 
      Nailsworth, you will know where Brewery Lane was, ...... and you must have 
      seen Hilliers Cotswold vans.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; I told you that everyone had 
      a pig, and there was also a local pig killer..... he was so efficient, it 
      was as humane as anything we get nowadays ..... a man called Hillier and 
      he died quite early, ..... and his son Isaac, who was very young, about 
      17, he set up a pig bake store in Newmarket.&nbsp; Market Street was where 
      they had the market - there were a large number of shops in Market Street 
      and also pubs....&nbsp; He had a hang-up stall - he would just have 
      somewhere where he hung up the bacons and he sold bacon. (He cured it 
      himself and sold it.)&nbsp; He lived in a cottage and, at that time, the 
      biggest mill in the area was Longfords Mill, and these people had the best 
      sausages.&nbsp; They cost quite a lot of money and, in those days, you 
      didn't get your wages all in money, you got it in kind.&nbsp; They had 
      what they called a tuck shop, and .... Isaac Hillier was asked to provide 
      bacon, and that led to Hillier meeting the daughter of the wealthy 
      Longford people and marrying her...he built a house, it is down where the 
      new factory is, and called it The Mansion..... Isaac had about five 
      children, two sons, one of them who was called Peter was going to take on 
      the business and then..... he got ill and the other son went up to London 
      to see him and he got thrown off his horse in Pall Mall and was killed. 
      [Peter also died.]"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"It is really rather sad because Isaac Hilliers is 
      cutting back at the moment, and it will be a very sad day if that ever 
      does go out of business.&nbsp; It used to be really a pretty place and 
      then there was a fire ..... and now they have that nasty iron place, and 
      all that is going to be taken down now and turned into houses.&nbsp; It 
      will be nice, but they are going to put all the factory into new 
      buildings, and we are all a bit worried because a lot of people are losing 
      their jobs....."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"I will tell you something which will bring us up to 
      modern times. Right up to 1931 we will go.&nbsp; In 1931, there was rain, 
      rather like we are having now.&nbsp; It rained solidly for about five 
      weeks until the ground was so soggy it couldn't accept any more water at 
      all, and it was on the August bank holiday and we used to have a wonderful 
      horse show here.&nbsp; It really was a good horse show, not as big as 
      Badminton, but people came from a long way around, and there were very 
      good prizes, in King George's Field, which was called Enoch's Field.&nbsp; 
      A great big wooden stand went up and everybody attended.&nbsp; it was a 
      great occasion, and, on this day, there were some of the most ghastly 
      thunderstorms, and there was a mill down here called the Node's Mill, and 
      it hadn't really been in use much.&nbsp; It was a bit derelict, but it 
      still had its dam, and the force of the water coming down swept away this 
      dam, and everything ran right down the Newmarket Valley, right down into 
      Cossack Square and Market Street, and of course a lot of streams meet in 
      Cossack Square, and then they go on and meet the stream from Avening.&nbsp; 
      And there was just a terrible flood, I mean I don't think anybody was 
      killed, but quite a lot of animals were killed and shops were completely 
      flooded and, in fact, I have actually got photographs... They are not very 
      clear, they are photocopies, but it really was so serious that they had 
      collection boxes for the disaster fund.&nbsp; It was a shock and there are 
      still people alive who can tell you how frightening it was, this water 
      coming down, and that is one reason why, in the seventies, they put a in 
      very straight bit of stream and that was put in to help control the water 
      when it rose suddenly."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">"Nailsworth was lots of different hamlets, lots of 
      them just working separately, and Nailsworth was actually in three 
      different parishes. Horsley, if you go down across the road, down the hill 
      into Nailsworth, that was the boundary between Horsley and Avening.&nbsp; 
      We were in Avening here, and then if you went across the stream by the 
      railway, you were in Minchinhampton, so about 100 years ago a gentleman 
      called Mr Clissold got us turned into a parish.&nbsp; Now we don't have an 
      Anglican church, that is the official church, in Nailsworth, we had an 
      Anglican chapel, but the Bishop didn't like it.&nbsp; He didn't come to 
      the chapel, so one of the first things they did was decide they must have 
      a parish church, and so the church we have now was built in 1900.So the 
      church is quite young - lots of places have churches much older than that 
      - but the old pepperpot chapel, it had a tower like a pepper pot.&nbsp; It 
      had a lovely clock, and there was a very famous person who made the clock, 
      and he made bells, and lots of Gloucestershire churches have bells made by 
      Mr Ruddle [Rudhall?], and we had bells, and when they took the pepperpot 
      church down, there was nowhere to put the clock.&nbsp; They were going to 
      build a great big tower on Nailsworth church, but they found that a great 
      big tower would collapse the bank, so they never built the tower, so what 
      did they do with the clock?&nbsp; They built the clock on the bank.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">If you look, near the pedestrian crossing and look 
      across, there are two iron things stuck on the wall, and Mr Clissold built 
      it.&nbsp; It was called the clock on stilts, and he built that, just to 
      keep the clock temporarily.&nbsp; It lasted fifty years, and ,after the 
      Second World war, it was decided to have a special wall built, and so they 
      built it down at the centre.&nbsp; The only bit of the old clock in that 
      is one of the bells, which chimes the quarter.&nbsp; The rest of the clock 
      is in Stroud Museum.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We also had a poet.&nbsp; Recently there was a 
      celebration for this poet, because it is fifty years since he died.&nbsp; 
      He was an interesting poet because he spent most of his time as a tramp 
      travelling around, and his name was W H Davies, and in one of his poems he 
      refers to that clock as a cross between a lighthouse and a window, so it 
      will go down in history.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There used to be a gorgeous grocer's shop [where 
      William's Kitchen is now].....and a lovely gentleman called Mr Fawkes ran
